description: Build the ATM framework runner and sync it to explicit internal adopter repositories with skip/exclude controls.

# ATM Internal Build Sync

Use this skill when the user asks to build an ATM framework version and sync the
fresh runner into internal repositories.

## First Command

```bash
node atm.mjs next --prompt "$ARGUMENTS" --json
```

Then inspect framework-development mode before release mutation:

```bash
node atm.mjs framework-mode status --json
node atm.mjs guard framework-development --json
```

## Sync Command

Pass every target repository explicitly. Do not bake adopter repository names
into framework source.

```bash
node atm.mjs internal-release sync --repo <repo-a> --repo <repo-b> --json
```

To intentionally skip one repository, match either its basename or full path:

```bash
node atm.mjs internal-release sync --repo <repo-a> --repo <repo-b> --skip <repo-b-name> --json
```

Useful switches:

- `--dry-run`: show what would be copied without writing target repos.
- `--no-build`: reuse the existing `release/atm-onefile/atm.mjs`.
- `--no-verify`: copy without running target `doctor`, `framework-mode status`, and `tasks audit`.
- `--allow-verify-failure`: copy and report verification failures without failing the command.

## Required Evidence

Capture the command JSON evidence, including:

- `sourceSha256`
- each target `previousSha256` and `newSha256`
- skipped targets and skip reason
- target verification command hashes and exit codes

Do not manually copy `atm.mjs` to target repositories when this command is
available.

- `INV-ATM-001` ??**No second registry** (enforcement: `gate`, breaking change: yes)
  Rule: A host project must not create a second AtomicRegistry implementation outside of packages/core or introduce a parallel ID allocation, version tracking, or registry promotion path.
- `INV-ATM-002` ??**Lock before edit** (enforcement: `doctor`, breaking change: no)
  Rule: No governed file mutation may occur without a valid ScopeLock recorded in .atm/locks/ for the current WorkItem. Agents must call atm lock before editing files.
- `INV-ATM-003` ??**Schema-validated promotion only** (enforcement: `gate`, breaking change: yes)
  Rule: An UpgradeProposal must pass all automatedGates (including JSON Schema validation) before promotion. Direct registry mutation that bypasses the UpgradeProposal path is forbidden.
- `INV-ATM-004` ??**No competing highest authority** (enforcement: `doctor`, breaking change: yes)
  Rule: No host project rule, profile, or configuration may declare itself to have authority equal to or higher than the AtomicCharter. Any rule that contradicts an invariant must go through a charter waiver proposal.
- `INV-ATM-005` ??**Host rule amendments require waiver flow** (enforcement: `waiver-required`, breaking change: no)
  Rule: When a host project rule conflicts with a charter invariant, the host must submit a behavior.evolve UpgradeProposal with a charterWaiver field and a linked HumanReviewDecision. Silent override is not permitted.
- `INV-ATM-006` ??**Framework work tracking stays target-local** (enforcement: `doctor`, breaking change: yes)
  Rule: The framework repository must not host downstream adopter planning queues or project-specific work tracking artifacts. ATM framework-development tasks may live in the framework repository only as ATM-managed .atm/history/tasks ledger records with CLI transition evidence.
- `INV-ATM-007` ??**Public framework docs remain English-only** (enforcement: `doctor`, breaking change: yes)
  Rule: Public contributor-facing documentation in the framework repository must remain English-only and repository-neutral. Non-English planning notes, local experiments, or downstream operating guidance must live in the coordinating host workspace unless they are translated into neutral English framework documentation.
- `INV-ATM-008` ??**Broker tickets, not refusals** (enforcement: `doctor`, breaking change: no)
  Rule: Every governed shared-write gate (runner-sync, build windows, release mirrors, git commit, projection regeneration) must respond with a broker ticket - execute now, enqueue with position, or batch into a shared write window - never a bare refusal. Reads and private writes (own ledger, evidence, task events, lane sessions) never queue. The only standing exceptions are the four owner-ruled cases in docs/governance/parallel-governance-charter.md; any new serialization point requires an explicit project-owner ruling before it ships.
- `INV-ATM-009` ??**Generalized repair and data-driven policy** (enforcement: `doctor`, breaking change: no)
  Rule: Any code logic change, bug fix, or governance rule change must first be designed as the most general rule that correctly explains the observed failure class. Hard-coded special cases are allowed only with recorded evidence that the general rule is not currently safe, feasible, or economical, and that the exception is bounded and reversible. Data-shaped behavior, including thresholds, mappings, allowlists, routing choices, telemetry classifications, prompts, message text, fixtures, and domain content, must first be modeled outside control flow through schemas, registries, configuration, observed counters, or compact digest evidence instead of embedded changeable numbers or strings. The generalized solution must remain observable, testable, and no broader than the evidence supports.
- `INV-ATM-010` ??**Single canonical worktree and compose-first shared writes** (enforcement: `doctor`, breaking change: no)
  Rule: Normal governed parallel development uses one canonical worktree, base, and HEAD. A shared physical file is compose-eligible rather than a file lock: workers declare bounded atom/CID/content-anchor/source-range intents and submit proposals, while the broker, format adapter, and transactional composer decide compose, revalidation, escalation, or queue. A neutral steward is the only shared-file writer and shared delivery records member attribution. Queueing or revalidation is a fallback for a true logical conflict, stale base/CAS failure, unsupported adapter, or fairness bound. AI workers must not use Git branches, detached worktrees, alternate indexes, merges, or rebases as normal concurrency/isolation mechanisms. The closed exceptions are emergency/anomaly recovery, historical read-only discrimination, and non-development sealed packaging; each requires a named receipt and cannot perform normal governed contribution writes.

Do not introduce a second registry, task state, or approval path.
