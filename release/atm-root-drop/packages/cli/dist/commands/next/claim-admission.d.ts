/**
 * TASK-RFT-0011 — next.claim.admission atom.
 *
 * The pre-fix bug: `broker register` returns `parallel-safe` /
 * `lane: direct-brokered` via `packages/core/src/broker/conflict-matrix.ts`,
 * but `next --claim` runs a separate parallel-preflight and throws
 * `ATM_NEXT_CLAIM_BLOCKED` on the same atom overlap. The two gates should
 * agree — one broker verdict, one CID gate — so an operator seeing "broker OK"
 * never gets a claim block a moment later.
 *
 * This module owns the policy decision "should next --claim admit this
 * candidate?" It takes two verdicts as inputs:
 *
 *   - the *broker verdict* — the arbitration verdict from
 *     `evaluateConflictMatrix(newIntent, activeIntents)` in the exact same
 *     module the `broker register` command uses. Passed in by the caller
 *     (next.ts) so this module stays pure and testable.
 *   - the *CID gate verdict* — the legacy diagnostic the `next --claim`
 *     preflight computes from `parallel` findings. This module treats it as a
 *     diagnostic wrapper: it does not gate on it, but it does surface a
 *     divergence diagnostic when the two disagree.
 *
 * The final admission decision is driven by the broker verdict. This means:
 *   - broker `allow` / `watch` → admitted
 *   - broker `freeze` → blocked (mirrors what `broker register` already tells
 *     the operator)
 *   - broker `takeover` → admitted with an advisory
